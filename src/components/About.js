      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I’m a Java Backend Developer with 3.5+ years of experience building scalable, 
        high-performance enterprise applications using Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, 
        and 3DEXPERIENCE ENOVIA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently working at Tata Consultancy Services on an automotive PLM platform for a 
        global automotive client. I design and develop backend systems that manage complex 
        engineering and EBOM data while ensuring reliability, performance, and maintainability.
      </p>

      <p>
        I actively use AI tools in my day-to-day development workflow to improve productivity, 
        code quality, and problem-solving — from design brainstorming and code optimization to 
        debugging and learning new technologies faster.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to grow into a Backend Architect role and work on large-scale distributed 
        systems powered by cloud, microservices, and AI-assisted engineering.
